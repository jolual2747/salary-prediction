# salary-prediction
This is a project about salary prediction based on data from Glassdoor with information related to data job salaries.


The purpose is to predict the salary for data scientist, data analysts and data engineers positions depending on variables like the job description, skills, state, sector and other information about the company.

The repository contains 2 notebooks.

1. `EDA.ipynb` with all the exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and feature extraction.
2. `modeling.ipynb` with all the development of the models and metrics for model's performance

Finally we had a MAE of 5.95k USD.

We could improve it if we had more data to train.
